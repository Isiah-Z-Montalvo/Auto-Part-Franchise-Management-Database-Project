There were a few assumptions made in the making of this ER Diagram. To represent the ISA Hierarchy, we made the User entity a disjointed superentity with manager and customer subentities. We used a green box to represent the aggregation of the manager-warehouse supply request relationship into a single higher level entity which has the delivered relationship to the store. We also represented the customer client side interactions as one interaction with many attributes consisting of viewing product, checking availability, and checking price. As customers can only order products from a store that is within 20 miles and has the product in stock, the order-product includes relationship has exact constraints set to the conditions. Product is a weak entity that is only defined through its relationship with the store entity and the store ID. Customers can also visit their profile and customize the variables assigned to the customer and inherited from the user.
